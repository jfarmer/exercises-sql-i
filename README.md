# A Toy Database

Here is a toy database which models an online music store.  In this database, we have falling into three categories: information about the company, information about customers and their orders, and information about the products being sold.

You'll be editing the `queries.sql` file, which consists of a series of
"plain English" sentences.  Your job is to translate those sentences into a
single SQL `SELECT` query.  Don't worry if you can't do it â€” take your best shot!

The database itself is contained in the `music-store.db` file.  The `import.sql`
file contains the raw SQL used to generate the toy database.  You don't need to
touch this file, but it's here in case we wind up needing it.  You'll be doing
your work in `queries.sql`.

## The Plain English Queries

See the `queries.sql`.  Open the database by running this in your terminal:

```bash
psql -hadjacent-sql-practice.czdcscfribvh.us-east-2.rds-preview.amazonaws.com -Uadjacent_student adjacent_sql_exercises
```
You will be prompted for a password. Ask your instructor for this information.

Once inside, type the following at the postgress prompt

```text
adjacent_sql_exercises> \dt;
```

to list all the tables in the database.  To see the schema for a specific table,
you can type, e.g., the `invoices` table

```text
adjacent_sql_exercises> \d+ invoices;
```

Don't be afraid to explore the data in the tables to get a better feeling
for how it's formatted.  It's impossible to damage your database as long
as you're only running `SELECT` queries.  For example, what does the data
in the invoices table look like?  Well, let's look at a 5 rows

```sql
SELECT * FROM invoices LIMIT 5;
```

That's what we mean by "explore."

## Configuring Postgress

The default settings for postgress can make it hard to read the output of `SELECT`
queries.  To change the settings, run the following command once you're inside
the Postgress shell.  You should just be able to copy and paste this line.

```text
\t
```

To turn this formatting on/off in postgress you can apply \t at any point while you're querying your database

When selecting large amounts of data from your database you can always page down the results by pressing enter or if you want to quit viewing the selected content type in q.


When you're ready to exit querying your database enter 

```text
\q
```

## The Database Tables

Remember: relational databases are organized into tables.  Each table has a "schema", which dictates the fields (aka columns) that the data in the table can or must contain.  The data itself is stored as records (aka rows).

Here are the tables, organized by high-level purpose.

### Information About The Products

1. `albums` are the albums our store is selling
2. `artists` are all the artists
3. `tracks` are all the tracks, containing a column that tells us which album the track belongs to.
4. `media_types` tell us what format a track is in, e.g., MP3, Apple Audio, etc.
5. `genres` are a list of genres.
6. `playlists` are, well, playlists.  A play list has many tracks and a single track can belong to many playlists.
7. `playlist_tracks` tells us which tracks belong to which playlists

### Information About Customers and Their Orders

1. `customers` are our customer records and they may or may not have an assigned "customer support representative"
2. `invoices` are a list of specific customer orders
3. `invoice_lines` are the line-items on specific invoices

### Information About The Company

1. `employees` contains information about our company's employees.  This is mostly used to assign support representatives to customers.

## One Key Idea

One of the key ideas in how relational databases like Postgress and MySQL organize data is that we try to minimize redundancy by using references to other data rather than duplicating that data between different tables.

For example, every track belongs to one (and only one) album.  An album has its own associated information, like album title, publication date, and so on.  Each track also has its own associated information, like track title, track position, and duration.  We want to be able to ask questions like "What is the title of the album on which track X appears?"

If you imagine a spreadsheet with a bunch of track listings, one way to achieve this would be to have an "Album Title" column and to answer this question we would just look at the value in the "Album Title" column for track X.  Every track on the same album would have the same value in the "Album Title" column, although heaven help us if there are two separate albums with the same title!

This is not how we store information in a relational database.  Rather than storing album-related information in the same table as track-related information, we store album-related information in an "albums" table and track-related information in a "tracks" table.  We assign each track and album a unique ID.  In the "tracks" table we would when have an `album_id` column containing the unique album ID as a *reference* or *pointer* to the relevant row in the "albums" table.

Excel can do this, but it is too cumbersome for the most common tasks.  In a relational database like Postgress or MySQL, however, it is much easier to deal with.  In fact, SQL (the language) is counting on you storing your data this way.
